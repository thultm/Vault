# Sound
## Definition 
- Produced by vibration of an object
- Vibrations cause air molecules to oscillate
- Change in air pressure creates a wave
## Sound wave

# Mechanical wave
- Oscillation that travels through space
- Energy travels from one point to another
- The medium is deformed
# Waveform
- Fundamental for certain transformations which are going to be very important to get important features about audio signals ![Waveform](https://i.imgur.com/3pXlrlX.png)
- Carries multifactorial information:
    - Frequency
    - Intensity
    - Timbre
- Periodic and aperiodic sound
    - All waveforms
    - Periodic
        - Simple (Single Sinewaves)
        - Complex (Multiple Sinewaves)
    - Aperiodic
        - Continuous (Noise)
        - Transient (Pulse)
## Periodic
### Simple

$$y(t)=A\sin(2\pi ft+\phi)$$
## Frequency (number of cycles per second) 
- Is amount of time that we need to elapse before having two peaks or for two dips.  
- Formula: $$ f=1/T $$
## Amplitude 
- Is how high or low a perturbation in air pressure goes.

## Phase 
- Is enables us to shift the waveform to the right or to the left and basically tell us what is the position of the waveform at time zero. ![](https://i.imgur.com/rv9TCZs.png)
## Hearing range
- Different animal, different hearing range
- Humanâ€™s hearing range: 20-20,000Hz

## Pitch
- Is the concepts that we use for the perception of frequency
- Logarithmic perception
- 2 frequencies are perceived similarly if they differ by a power of 2
## Midi notes
- Is how does that map onto the idea of frequency
- Example: A4: 440Hz so A5 is 880Hz
## Pitch-frequency chart
## Mapping pitch to frequency
$$F(p)=2^{\frac{p-69}{12}}\cdot440$$
where: $p$ is pitch
- The ratio between two subsequent semitones $$\frac{F(p+1)}{F(p)}=2^\frac{1}{12}=1.059$$
## Cents
- Octave divided in 1200 cents
- 100 cents in a semitone
- Noticeable pitch difference: 10-25 cents
