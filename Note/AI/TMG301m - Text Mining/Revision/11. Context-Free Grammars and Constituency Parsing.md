1. Context-Free Grammars (CFGs):
    
    - CFGs are a formal system used to describe the syntax or structure of natural language.
    - They consist of rules or productions that specify how symbols (both terminal and non-terminal) can be combined to form valid sentences in the language.
    - CFGs are widely used in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and parsing algorithms.
2. Constituency:
    
    - Constituency refers to the grouping of words into meaningful units or constituents.
    - In the context of syntax, constituents are groups of words that can function as a single unit in a sentence.
    - For example, a noun phrase (NP) is a constituent that includes a noun and any modifiers or determiners that accompany it.
3. CFG Rules:
    
    - CFG rules specify the possible ways in which symbols can be combined.
    - Each rule consists of a non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side (LHS) and a sequence of terminals and/or non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS).
    - The rules define the hierarchical structure of the language and how different constituents can be formed.
    - For example, the rule NP â†’ Det Nominal indicates that an NP can be formed by combining a determiner (Det) with a nominal (Nominal).
4. Lexicon:
    
    - The lexicon of a CFG contains the terminal symbols, which represent the words or lexical items in the language.
    - Each word is associated with a lexical category or part of speech, which is a non-terminal symbol in the CFG.
    - The lexicon provides the vocabulary for constructing valid sentences according to the CFG rules.
5. Derivations and Parse Trees:
    
    - A derivation is a step-by-step process of applying CFG rules to generate a sentence.
    - Starting from a designated start symbol, each rule is applied to rewrite non-terminal symbols until only terminal symbols remain.
    - A parse tree is a graphical representation of a derivation, showing the hierarchical structure of a sentence.
    - The nodes in the tree correspond to constituents, and the edges represent the application of CFG rules.
6. Syntax and Parsing:
    
    - Syntax is the study of how words combine to form grammatically valid sentences.
    - Parsing is the process of analyzing a sentence according to the rules of a grammar.
    - Syntactic parsing involves assigning a structure (such as a parse tree) to a sentence, which helps in understanding its grammatical structure and meaning.
    - The CKY algorithm is a widely used dynamic programming algorithm for parsing context-free grammars and generating parse trees.
7. Expandability of CFGs:
    
    - CFGs can be expanded to include more complex structures and grammatical rules.
    - For example, verb phrases (VPs) can be defined as a verb followed by other constituents like noun phrases or prepositional phrases.
    - By extending the set of rules and symbols, CFGs can account for the diverse linguistic structures found in natural language.
