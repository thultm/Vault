1. Vocabulary Acquisition: Fluent speakers possess a vast amount of knowledge, which is primarily embodied in their vocabulary. This includes not only the words themselves but also their grammatical function, meaning, real-world reference, and pragmatic function.
    
2. Vocabulary Growth: To reach the observed vocabulary levels by the age of 20, children need to learn about 7 to 10 words per day consistently. This vocabulary growth occurs primarily through daily experiences, especially reading. Research suggests that the acquisition of vocabulary through reading is more effective than direct vocabulary instruction in schools.
    
3. Distributional Hypothesis: The distributional hypothesis suggests that word meanings can be learned based on the associations between words encountered in texts, even without grounding in the real world. This knowledge is acquired through the complex associations of words with the words they co-occur with. By analyzing the content of texts encountered over our lives, we can learn about word meanings and use this knowledge in language processing.
    
4. Pretraining and Pretrained Language Models: Pretraining involves learning representations of meaning for words or sentences by processing vast amounts of text. This process enables the creation of pretrained language models, which are models that have learned from a large corpus of text and can be utilized for various NLP tasks. Pretrained language models capture a wide range of linguistic patterns and can provide valuable insights for downstream applications.
    
5. Transformers: Transformers are a popular architecture for language modeling. They offer new mechanisms such as self-attention and positional encodings. Unlike traditional recurrent connections in models like RNNs, transformers can efficiently represent long-range dependencies and capture relationships between words over extended distances.
    
6. Self-Attention Networks: Self-attention is a key mechanism in transformers that allows the network to extract and utilize information from large contexts without passing it through recurrent connections. It enables parallelization and efficient implementation at scale. Self-attention operates by computing the similarity between each input item and all other items in the sequence, generating attention weights that reflect the relevance of each item to the others.
    
7. Information Flow in Self-Attention: In a self-attention layer, each input item has access to all previous inputs but no information about future inputs. The comparison between items is typically performed using dot products, which measure the similarity between their representations. The resulting scores are then normalized using the softmax function to obtain attention weights. The output for each input item is computed as a weighted sum of the input items, where the weights are determined by the attention weights.
    
8. Sophisticated Representation: Transformers provide a more sophisticated representation of how words contribute to the representation of longer inputs. Each input embedding in a transformer serves three roles: query, key, and value. The query determines which parts of the input are relevant, the key represents the context against which relevance is evaluated, and the value holds the information to be attended to. This comprehensive understanding of word relationships allows transformers to capture complex patterns and dependencies in language.
