1. Meaning Representations: Meaning representations are formal structures that capture the meaning of linguistic expressions. They link linguistic elements to non-linguistic knowledge about the world. Different meaning representation languages, such as First-Order Logic, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), frame-based representation, and slot-filler representation, can be used to represent meaning.
    
2. Dual Perspective: Meaning representations can be viewed from two perspectives. Firstly, they represent the meaning of a linguistic input, such as a sentence or phrase. Secondly, they represent the state of affairs in the world, capturing the relationships between objects, properties, and actions. This dual perspective enables the connection between linguistic inputs and our knowledge of the world.
    
3. Verifiability: Verifiability refers to a system's ability to compare a meaning representation to a knowledge base and determine its truthfulness. For example, when answering a question like "Does Maharani serve vegetarian food?", the system needs to match the representation "Serves(Maharani, VegetarianFood)" with the facts in its knowledge base to provide a correct answer.
    
4. Unambiguous Representations: While natural language can be ambiguous, meaning representations themselves should be unambiguous. Ambiguity arises when a single expression can have multiple meanings in different contexts. However, meaning representations should have a clear and specific interpretation, allowing systems to reason effectively.
    
5. Vagueness: Vagueness refers to situations where meaning representations leave certain aspects of the meaning underspecified. For example, when a user says "I want to eat Italian food," the representation may be vague regarding the user's specific preferences. Vagueness can be appropriate for some purposes but may require more specific representations for other purposes.
    
6. Canonical Form: Canonical form suggests that different linguistic expressions with the same meaning should have the same meaning representation. This simplifies reasoning since systems only need to deal with a single representation for multiple expressions. For example, the sentences "Does Maharani have vegetarian dishes?" and "Do they have vegetarian food at Maharani?" should map to the same canonical meaning representation.
    
7. Inference: Meaning representations enable inference, which involves drawing valid conclusions based on the representation and background knowledge. Inference allows systems to reason about relationships, make deductions, and provide meaningful responses.
    
8. Variables: Meaning representations can utilize variables to represent unknown objects or entities. Variables allow for flexibility in capturing different instances of a concept. For example, in the representation "Serves(x, VegetarianFood)," the variable 'x' can represent any restaurant that serves vegetarian food.
