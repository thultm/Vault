1. Affective meaning refers to the emotional, evaluative, and subjective aspects of language. It encompasses the expression of emotions, sentiments, attitudes, moods, and interpersonal stances in written or spoken communication.
    
2. Scherer's typology of affective states categorizes them into different classes:
    
    a. Emotion: Emotions are relatively brief episodes of response to the evaluation of an external or internal event as being of major significance. Examples of emotions include anger, sadness, joy, fear, shame, pride, elation, and desperation.
    
    b. Mood: Moods are diffuse affective states that are characterized by a change in subjective feeling. They have low intensity but relatively long duration and often lack an apparent cause. Examples of moods include cheerfulness, gloominess, irritability, listlessness, depression, and buoyancy.
    
    c. Interpersonal stance: This refers to the affective stance that a person takes toward another individual in a specific interaction. It colors the interpersonal exchange in that situation. Examples of interpersonal stances include being distant, cold, warm, supportive, contemptuous, or friendly.
    
    d. Attitude: Attitudes are relatively enduring affectively colored beliefs, preferences, and predispositions towards objects or persons. Attitudes can range from liking, loving, and hating to valuing and desiring.
    
    e. Personality traits: Personality traits are stable dispositions and behavior tendencies that are emotionally laden and typical for a person. Examples of personality traits include being nervous, anxious, reckless, morose, hostile, or jealous.
    
3. Sentiment lexicons, also known as affective lexicons, are lists of words that carry particularly strong cues to affect or sentiment. These lexicons help determine the affective status of a text and can be useful in sentiment analysis or other affective tasks.
    
4. Connotation lexicons capture the affective meanings or emotional associations of words. They provide insights into the emotional connotations or evaluations that a word may carry. Connotation lexicons are valuable resources for understanding the affective dimensions of language.
    
5. Building lexicons can be done through different methods:
    
    a. Human labeling: In this approach, human annotators assign affective labels or ratings to words, phrases, or texts based on their emotional connotations.
    
    b. Semi-supervised: This method combines human labeling with automatic techniques to expand the lexicon. It leverages existing labeled data and uses statistical methods to infer the affective properties of unlabeled data.
    
    c. Supervised: This approach uses machine learning algorithms trained on labeled data to automatically classify words or texts into affective categories.
    
6. Detecting affect towards a particular entity involves identifying the emotional or evaluative stance expressed towards that entity. For example, detecting emotions expressed towards characters in novels can help us understand how different social groups were viewed by society at different times.
    
7. Connotation frames provide a structured representation of the connotations associated with different words. They capture the affective dimensions and associations of words in a systematic way, aiding in the analysis of affective meaning.
