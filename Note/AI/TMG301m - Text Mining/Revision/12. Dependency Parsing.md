1. Dependency grammars: Dependency grammars are an alternative to constituent-based grammars. Instead of focusing on phrasal constituents and phrase-structure rules, dependency grammars describe the syntactic structure of a sentence by emphasizing directed binary grammatical relations between words. These relations capture the dependencies between words in a sentence.
    
2. Typed dependency structures: In dependency parsing, the relations between words are represented by directed, labeled arcs. These arcs connect heads (words that govern or control the relationship) to dependents (words that are governed or controlled). The labels on the arcs indicate the specific grammatical relations between the head and the dependent. This representation is called a typed dependency structure because the labels are drawn from a fixed inventory of grammatical relations.
    
3. Advantages of dependency grammars: Dependency grammars have several advantages. Firstly, they provide a more direct and explicit representation of the relationships between words, making it easier to capture semantic information. Secondly, dependency structures can handle languages with flexible word order more effectively. Since the structure is based on dependencies rather than strict constituent order, it can accommodate various word orders without the need for complex rules.
    
4. Dependency relations: Dependency relations describe the grammatical functions that dependents play with respect to their heads. Some common dependency relations include:
    

- NSUBJ (nominal subject): The dependent is the subject of the head verb.
- OBJ (direct object): The dependent is the direct object of the head verb.
- IOBJ (indirect object): The dependent is the indirect object of the head verb.
- NMOD (nominal modifier): The dependent modifies a noun head.
- AMOD (adjectival modifier): The dependent modifies an adjective head.
- NUMMOD (numeric modifier): The dependent modifies a numeral head.
- APPOS (appositional modifier): The dependent provides additional information about the head noun.
- DET (determiner): The dependent is a determiner that modifies a noun head.

These examples illustrate how dependency relations capture the syntactic and semantic relationships between words in a sentence.

5. Universal Dependencies: The Universal Dependencies (UD) project is a collaborative effort to annotate dependencies and other aspects of grammar across more than 100 languages. It provides a standardized inventory of 37 dependency relations that can be used across different languages. The goal is to achieve consistency and comparability in dependency parsing across a wide range of languages.
    
6. Representing dependency structures: Dependency structures can be represented as directed graphs, where the vertices represent the words in a sentence, and the arcs represent the directed grammatical relations between them. The arcs indicate the dependency direction, from the head to the dependent. This graph-based representation allows for a visual and formal representation of the sentence structure.
    
7. Dependency formalisms: Different grammatical theories or formalisms may impose additional constraints on dependency structures. For example, some formalisms require a designated root node that marks the root of the dependency tree. Other formalisms may enforce connectivity, ensuring that every word in the sentence is connected to the root or other words in the sentence. Acyclicity is another constraint that some formalisms impose, disallowing cycles or loops in the dependency structure.
    
8. Projectivity: Projectivity is a property of dependency trees that requires that the arcs from a head to its dependents form a connected path without crossing or overlapping with other arcs. In other words, projective dependency trees maintain a linear order of words in the sentence. While projectivity is often assumed in dependency parsing, some languages with flexible word order may have non-projective trees where certain arcs violate the projectivity constraint.
