1. Regular Expressions:  
    Regular expressions are powerful tools for working with text patterns. They allow you to ***specify complex search patterns and perform operations*** such as matching, searching, and replacing strings. Regular expressions are *widely used in various fields, including computer science, data processing, text processing tools, and programming languages.* Here are some additional points to understand:

- Regular expressions ***can match sequences of characters, single characters, or disjunctions of characters.*** For example, the regular expression "cat" matches the string "cat" in any text.
- They can be ***used to handle case sensitivity.*** For instance, the regular expression "cat" matches "cat" but not "Cat" or "CAT".
- ***Square brackets are used to specify character ranges or negations.*** For example, the regular expression "\[a-z\]" matches any lowercase letter.
- Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to work with text patterns and allow for efficient searching and processing of textual data.

2. Text Normalization:  
    Text normalization involves ***transforming text into a more standardized and consistent form.*** It encompasses various techniques to enhance text processing and analysis. Here are some key aspects of text normalization:

- Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of ***breaking up a text into individual words or tokens.*** It considers factors such as whitespace, punctuation, and special characters to determine word boundaries. Tokenization is crucial for many natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and language modeling.
- Lemmatization: Lemmatization aims to ***identify the base or root form (lemma) of words.*** It reduces inflected forms to a common base form, which helps in tasks like information retrieval and text mining. For example, the lemma of "running" is "run".
- Stemming: Stemming is another technique that ***reduces words to their base or stem form by removing suffixes.*** Unlike lemmatization, ***stemming does not consider the context or part of speech.*** For instance, the stem of "running" is "run".
- Sentence Segmentation: Sentence segmentation involves ***breaking up a text into individual sentences.*** It ***relies on punctuation cues*** such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. Accurate sentence segmentation is vital in many language processing tasks, including machine translation and sentiment analysis.

3. Edit Distance:  
    Edit distance, ***also known as Levenshtein distance***, is ***a metric used to measure the similarity between two strings.*** It ***quantifies the number of edits (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) needed to transform one string into another***. Here's more information about edit distance:

- Edit distance is ***widely used in various applications,*** such as spelling correction, DNA sequence alignment, and speech recognition.
- ***The lower*** the edit distance between two strings, ***the more similar*** they are considered to be.
- Edit distance can ***help identify spelling errors and suggest correct alternatives by finding words with low edit distances.***
- It is also ***used in coreference resolution, where it helps determine whether two expressions refer to the same entity by comparing their similarities.***
