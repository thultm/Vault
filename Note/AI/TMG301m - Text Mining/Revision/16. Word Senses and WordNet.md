1. Word Senses:
    
    - A word sense is a discrete representation of a specific aspect of the meaning of a word.
    - For example, the word "bank" can have multiple senses, such as "a financial institution" or "a sloping land beside a body of water."
    - Each sense is represented with a superscript to differentiate them, e.g., bank1 and bank2, mouse1 and mouse2.
2. DeÔ¨Åning Word Senses:
    
    - Dictionaries and thesauruses offer different ways to define word senses.
    - Glosses: Glosses are textual definitions associated with each sense. They are written for people and provide a general understanding of the sense.
    - Example: The glosses for two senses of "bank" could be "financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities" and "sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)."
    - Sense Relations: Word senses can also be defined through their relationships with other senses.
        - For example, the senses of "right" and "left" are similar and stand in an alternation or opposition to each other.
        - Sense relations like IS-A (hierarchical) and antonymy (opposite meanings) are explicitly represented in databases like WordNet.
3. Representation of Word Senses:
    
    - Embeddings: Embedding models like word2vec and GloVe represent word meanings based on co-occurrence statistics, where words that appear in similar contexts have similar embeddings.
    - Contextual Embeddings: Contextual embeddings, such as BERT, capture the meaning of a word in its textual context. They provide more refined representations of word senses.
    - Sentence Embeddings: Glosses and example sentences associated with word senses can be used to compute sentence embeddings, which provide information about the meaning of the sense.
4. Determining the Number of Senses:
    
    - Identifying the number of senses a word has can be challenging and depends on several factors.
    - Independent Truth Conditions: Different senses of a word have different truth conditions; they refer to distinct entities or concepts.
    - Syntactic Behavior: Senses can have different syntactic behavior, such as being compatible with certain prepositions or verbs.
    - Sense Relations: Senses can be differentiated based on their relationships with other senses, such as antonymy or hierarchical relations.
    - Techniques like zeugma, which involve conjoining antagonistic readings, can help identify distinct senses of a word.
