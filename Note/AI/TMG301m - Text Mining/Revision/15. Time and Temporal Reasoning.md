1. Representing Time:
    
    - Temporal logic provides a framework for representing temporal information in a systematic manner.
    - Events can be associated with points or intervals in time on a timeline.
    - The tense of verbs can be used to indicate different temporal relationships, such as past, present, and future.
    - The Davidsonian scheme for representing events involves reifying events and capturing their essential properties.
2. Interval Algebra:
    
    - The interval algebra, developed by Allen, is a widely used tool for modeling temporal relationships.
    - It represents events and time expressions as intervals, without considering individual points in time.
    - Allen defines 13 primitive relations that describe the possible relationships between temporal intervals, such as before, after, overlaps, meets, equals, starts, finishes, during, etc.
3. Reichenbach's Reference Point:
    
    - Reichenbach's approach separates the reference point from the utterance time and event time.
    - The reference point is the time with respect to which an event is situated.
    - Different verb tenses can indicate different relationships between the reference point, the utterance time, and the event time.
    - The reference point theory allows for a more nuanced understanding of temporal relationships, accounting for events that occur before, during, or after a reference point.
4. Metaphorical Conceptual Organization:
    
    - Language often uses spatial terms to convey temporal information.
    - Metaphorical mappings between space and time are used to help understand and communicate temporal concepts.
    - For example, expressions like "moving forward in time" or "looking back on the past" rely on spatial metaphors to convey temporal ideas.
5. Aspect:
    
    - Aspect refers to the internal temporal structure of events.
    - It categorizes events based on their ongoing or completed nature, as well as whether they occur at a point in time or over an interval.
    - Different languages may have different aspectual categories, such as perfective (completed) and imperfective (ongoing).
    - Aspect plays a crucial role in understanding the temporal nature of events and their relations.
