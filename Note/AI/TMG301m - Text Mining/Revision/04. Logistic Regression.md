1. Logistic regression is an important algorithm for ***discovering the relationship between features or cues and a particular outcome.***
2. It is widely used in social and natural sciences, as well as in natural language processing.
3. Logistic regression can be used for ***binary classification*** (e.g., positive vs. negative sentiment) or for ***multi-class classification***.
4. Naive Bayes and logistic regression are different types of classifiers. Naive Bayes is a generative classifier, while logistic regression is a discriminative classifier.
5. Logistic regression involves ***four*** main components: ***feature representation of the input, classification function, objective function for learning, and an optimization algorithm.***
6. The training phase of logistic regression involves using ***stochastic gradient descent and cross-entropy loss*** to learn the weights and bias terms.
7. In the test phase, the classifier computes the ***probability of an observation belonging to a certain class and makes a decision based on the higher probability.***
8. The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is ***used to convert the weighted sum of inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1.***
9. The sigmoid function is defined as $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$, where $z$ is the weighted sum of inputs.
10. Logistic regression ***aims to find the optimal weights and bias terms that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.***
