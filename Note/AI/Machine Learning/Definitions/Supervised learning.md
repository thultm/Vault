# Definition
>Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of [[Machine learning|Machine learning]] and [[Artificial Intelligence]]. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
- Labeled data
- Learns from being given "**right answers**"

|     Input (X)     | Output (Y)             | Application         |
|:-----------------:| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
|       email       | spam? (0/1)            | spam filtering      |
|       audio       | text transcripts       | speech recognition  |
|      English      | Spanish                | machine translation |
|   ad, user info   | click? (0/1)           | online advertising  |
| image, radar info | position of other cars | self-driving car    |
|  image of phone   | defect? (0/1)          | visual inspection   |

# Type of supervised learning
- [[Regression]]: Predict a **number** from infinitely **many possible outputs** 
- [[Classification]]: predict **categories** on **small number of possible outputs**
- Some of algorithms
	- [[Linear regression]]
	- SVM
