- Is a subset of [[Artificial Intelligence]] .
# What is [[Machine learning]] 
- New capability for computers
- Grew out of work in [[Artificial Intelligence]] 
## Example
- Database mining (web click data, medical records,...)
- Applications can't program by hand(Autonomous helicopter), handwriting reconigtion, most of NLP, Computer Vision)
- Self-customizing programs
- Understand human learning
## Definition
> "[[Machine learning]] is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. "
\ - (Arthur Samuel - 1959)
- Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer prograam is said to *learn from experience* E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measure by P, improve with experience E.
