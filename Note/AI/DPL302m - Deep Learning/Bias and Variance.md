- If the [[Training set]] error is low, but the [[Validation set]] is high, then the model may have high variance 
- If the [[Training set]] error is high, but the [[Validation set]] is also high, then the model may have high variance 
- If the [[Training set]] error is high, but the [[Validation set]] is even higher, then the model may have high variance 
# Basic recipe for [[Machine learning]]
- First step, deifine high bias problem:
	- Pick a larger network with more hidden layers or hidden units, train for a longer time, or try a more advanced optimization algorithm.
	- If none of these options works, trying a different neural network architecture.
	- The goal is to reduce bias to an acceptable amount.
- Second, define high variance problem:
	- Get more data, using [[Regularization]], or trying a more appropriate neural network architecture.
	- The goal is to reduce variance to an acceptable amount.
	- [[Regularization]] can reduce variance but can increase bias slightly.
