# Introduction
## Brief history of search engines and emergence of SEO
- Early search engines in the 1990s included Archie for FTP searches and Veronica for keyword searching.
- Google emerges in late 1990s and quickly dominates with its PageRank algorithm that ranked results based on links and relevance.
- As Google grows, website owners realize high Google rankings drive traffic. This leads to the emergence of SEO.
- Early SEO focuses on techniques like keyword stuffing, link farms, doorway pages to try to game the Google algorithm.
- Google fights back with algorithm updates to penalize spammy practices and reward high-quality content.
- SEO evolves into a mix of white hat (on-page optimization, quality content) and gray hat (backlink building) techniques.
- Search engines continue to fight SEO spam while SEO practices focus more on user experience and organic growth vs manipulation.
- Mobile and voice search grow, requiring SEO to adapt to new algorithms that prioritize mobile-friendly pages and natural language.
- SEO becomes integrated into overall digital marketing strategy rather than a standalone tactic.
## Definition of SEO and its goals
- Here is a definition of SEO and its key goals:
	- SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It refers to the techniques and strategies used to increase the ranking and visibility of a website in unpaid/organic search engine results.
- The main goals of SEO are:
	- Improve ranking - The higher a site ranks for relevant keywords, the more likely it is to be seen and clicked on by searchers. So SEO aims to improve ranking in search engines like Google.
	- Increase traffic - By ranking higher, SEO drives more qualified visitors to your site from organic search. More traffic = more potential customers.
	- Boost conversions - More traffic is pointless without conversions. SEO helps drive visitors who are actively searching for your products/services, making them more likely to convert.
	- Enhance user experience - Search engines want to provide the best user experience. SEO makes a site more visible for relevant queries, providing a better experience.
	- Be found for keywords - Ranking for strategic keywords gets a site found for searches users are performing. This allows targeting of the right audiences.
	- Build authority - Ranking highly for industry keywords establishes expertise and authority in that space. This lends credibility.
	- Cost effective - SEO provides results without paid search advertising costs, making it extremely cost efficient.
So in summary, SEO aims to boost non-paid visibility and traffic from search engines through better ranking, which also provides business benefits like conversions, user experience, and authority building.
# Classification of Search Engines
## Crawler-based (Google, Bing)
- Crawler-based search engines use automated bots called "crawlers" or "spiders" to browse the web and catalog pages.
- The crawler follows links and indexes page content like text, images, keywords, backlinks etc.
- The crawler returns this data to the search engine, which processes and stores it in an indexed database for searching.
- When a user performs a search, the engine scans its index and provides results, ranking them by relevance using algorithms like PageRank.
- PageRank ranks pages based on factors like incoming links, keyword density, site authority.
- Google and Bing are the most widely used crawler-based search engines currently.
- Their large-scale crawlers index billions of web pages, which allows them to return comprehensive search results.
- They constantly crawl the web to keep their indexes up-to-date as content changes.
- Crawler-based engines rely on their algorithm's interpretation of page relevance to rank results.
So in summary, Google, Bing and other major search engines use powerful crawlers to index the web and algorithms like PageRank to rank results based on automated analysis of page content and links.
## Human-powered directories
- Human-powered directories rely on manual submissions and human review instead of automated crawlers.
- Site owners submit their pages to the directory and provide descriptive information like keywords, site descriptions, and suggested categories.
- Human editors review these submissions to evaluate the relevance and appropriateness of the content.
- The editors organize submissions into hierarchical categories and directories.
- Searching the directory takes users directly to categorized listings of sites based on the editorial curation.
- Rankings in human-powered directories depend on the editors' decisions rather than automated ranking algorithms.
- Listings may be ranked alphabetically or chronologically rather than by relevance.
- Examples of human-powered directories include the Open Directory Project (DMOZ) and Yahoo Directory.
- Human-powered directories have declined in popularity with the rise of sophisticated crawler-based search engines.
- However, human curation is still useful for providing a layered directory structure to search.
So in summary, human-powered directories relied on manual submission and editorial curation to organize websites, in contrast to the automated algorithms of crawler-based search engines.
## Hybrid models
- Hybrid search engines use a combination of automated crawling technology and human-powered curation.
- They typically use crawlers to index a large corpus of web pages, just like standard crawler-based engines.
- However, they also incorporate human-reviewed submissions and directory structures.
- The human-powered elements allow the addition of pages that crawlers may not detect, like new or thinly linked sites.
- The human classification provides hierarchical categorization of results.
- The automated crawlers provide comprehensive coverage and relevance-based ranking within categories.
- In this way, hybrid models aim to provide the benefits of scale from crawlers along with the curation and organization from human editors.
- The paper does not provide examples of hybrid search engines.
- But in practice, platforms like Google incorporate human-reviewed listings such as Google Business Profiles along with crawled pages.
- Similarly, Yahoo combines automated web search with its human-edited directory structure.
- Hybrid search engines demonstrate that automation and human curation can complement each other in search.
So in summary, hybrid search engines blend automated crawling with human-powered submissions and categorization to deliver the benefits of each approach.
# SEO Techniques
## White hat vs black hat techniques
### White Hat SEO
- Follows search engine guidelines and promotes "natural" optimization
- Focuses on relevance, user experience, and high-quality content
- Tactics include:
    - Keyword research
    - On-page optimization (meta tags, headings, alt text)
    - High-quality content creation
    - Improving site architecture
    - Getting credible inbound links
    - Social media engagement
- Results in sustainable rankings and traffic
### Black Hat SEO
- Attempts to "trick" search engine algorithms through unethical means
- Uses spammy tactics solely to boost rankings
- Tactics include:
    - Keyword stuffingÂ - Filling content with excessive target keywords.
    - Hidden text or links
    - Article spinning - create many similar variants of the same article
    - Link farms - manipulate backlinks.
    - Cloaking - providing different content to search engines and users.
    - Scraping or stealing content
- Provides unsustainable results and risks penalization
### Key Differences:
- White hat aims for relevance; black hat aims to manipulate rankings
- White hat earns trust; black hat takes shortcuts
- White hat aligns with search engine goals; black hat works against them
- White hat delivers long-term results; black hat offers short-term gains
So in summary, white hat SEO promotes organic optimization while black hat uses unethical shortcuts, but white hat is more sustainable long-term.
## On-page optimization (keywords, metadata, content)
- On-page optimization includes changes made directly to the HTML code and content of a web page.
- Keyword research is critical to identify relevant terms and phrases to optimize for. These are incorporated into page content.
- Title tags and meta descriptions should include target keywords and effectively summarize page content.
- The URL structure should be simplified and keyword-rich to improve click-throughs.
- Headings tags (H1, H2, etc) emphasize important keywords and topics in the content.
- The body content should focus on unique, high-quality information around target keywords.
- Keyword density and placement within the content helps search engines understand relevancy.
- Image alt text and captions provide additional keyword optimization opportunities.
- Effective internal linking allows crawlers to better index all relevant page content.
- Site speed optimizations like minification improve crawlability and user experience.
- Regular site audits help catch technical issues that impact SEO.
- On-page factors directly influence how search engines perceive and rank a specific page.
So in summary, on-page SEO focuses directly on the content and code of a page to help search engines properly interpret and value that page.
## Off-page optimization (backlinks, social media, directories)
- Off-page optimization refers to actions taken outside a website to improve its search rankings.
- A major off-page factor is link-building, which means getting other relevant sites to link back to your pages.
- The more quality backlinks from authoritative sources, the more search engines see a site as reputable.
- Social sharing and engagement on networks like Facebook and Twitter also help build visibility.
- Getting listed in human-edited directories and review sites provides credibility.
- PR efforts like press releases, guest blogging, and partnerships allow outreach to new sites.
- Social media optimization tactics like using relevant hashtags and keywords in posts can help with search visibility.
- Reviews and testimonials contain keywords and links that provide signals to search engines.
- Citations register business info like name, address, and phone number consistently across key sites.
- Off-page factors indirectly signal to search engines that a site is trusted and recognized.
So in summary, off-page SEO focuses on earning trust and authority through external signals like backlinks, social media, directories, and citations.
# Importance of SEO
## Statistics on search engine use and focus on first page/top results
- There were over 1.9 billion websites on the internet as of October 2018, according to the paper.
- The paper states that the majority of people rely on search engines to find specific websites or topics online.
- Per the paper, over 94% of search engine users only click on results from the first page.
- If they don't find what they need on the first page, most users will change the search query rather than go to the second page.
- The paper cites a statistic that approximately 63% of searchers only focus on the top 3 organic results on the first page, referred to as the "golden triangle."
- Ranking in these coveted top spots makes a website much more visible to searchers.
- Being on the first page, especially in the top 3, will result in substantially more search traffic driven to a website.
- This demonstrates the importance of ranking highly in search engines and the focus on the first page and top spots.
- SEO aims to achieve those high rankings in order to gain more visibility and traffic from searchers who concentrate on the top results.
So in summary, key statistics show that ranking on the first page, particularly in the top 3 results, is critical for search visibility and traffic, which is a major goal of SEO.
## SEO improves visibility and drives traffic to websites
- With billions of webpages online, search engines help users find relevant information.
- SEO improves the rankings of pages in search results for specific keyword searches.
- Higher rankings make pages more visible to searchers looking for those keywords.
- The paper states that over 94% of searchers only view the first page of results.
- So ranking on page one exposes sites to the vast majority of search traffic.
- Top rankings (like the top 3 results) get exceptional visibility since most focus is on those.
- By optimizing for keywords that match user intent, sites can target relevant traffic.
- SEO drives qualified visitors from search, unlike paid ads which can attract the wrong traffic.
- The paper suggests SEO allows businesses to gain visibility and traffic without search advertising costs.
- So organic search eliminates the cost per click of paid search.
- In competitive spaces, SEO may be the most cost-efficient way to get found and drive traffic.
- This incoming traffic from high rankings is like "free advertising" from the search engine.
So in summary, the paper highlights how SEO, by improving search engine rankings, can significantly boost a website's visibility and drive more relevant traffic to it.
# Page Ranking Algorithms
## Brief overview of PageRank, HITS, etc.
### PageRank Algorithm:
- It is one of the earliest and most widely used algorithm for ranking web pages.
- It was developed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
- The PageRank of a page is calculated based on the number and quality of links to that page. Pages that are linked to by more important pages get a higher PageRank.
- It assumes that a link to a page is a vote of support and pages that receive higher votes (links) are more important.
- The PageRank of the page gets distributed among all the pages it links to. So pages linked from pages with higher PageRank also gain PageRank.
### HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) Algorithm:
- It was developed by Jon Kleinberg in 1999 as an alternative to PageRank.
- It divides pages into two types - hubs and authorities.
- Hubs are pages that point to many other relevant pages on a given topic, while authorities are pages that are pointed to by many hubs as being relevant to that topic.
- It assigns a hub weight and authority weight to each page based on the page's relations to other hubs and authorities.
- The hub weights and authority weights are calculated through an iterative algorithm until it converges.
### Aggregated PageRank (APR) Algorithm:
- It is a modified PageRank algorithm proposed in one of the papers cited.
- It calculates the page rank by considering both the incoming links as well as contents/text on the web page.
- Every webpage is assigned a unique numeric value based on its contents.
- Then the regular PageRank algorithm is applied to calculate the importance score based on both links and contents.
- It provides a more accurate estimation of importance/rank compared to standard PageRank.
### M-HITS Algorithm:
- A modification of HITS algorithm proposed in one of the papers.
- It considers 6 parameters instead of just 2 in HITS - bold words, italic words, keywords, clicks, hub values, authority values.
- Each parameter is assigned a different weight and the rank is calculated based on the sum of weights.
- Provides a more comprehensive ranking by considering additional on-page factors.
## How they work to rank pages based on keywords, backlinks, etc.
### PageRank Algorithm:
- Works based on the link structure of the web and distribution of PageRank across links.
- Pages that are linked to by many pages receive higher PageRank.
- Keywords don't directly affect PageRank, but pages containing relevant keywords are more likely to receive more links, improving their PageRank over time.
### HITS Algorithm:
- Identifies hubs and authorities based on link patterns for a given search keyword/topic.
- Pages containing the keyword that receive many links from other pages get higher authority scores.
- Pages linking to many authority pages get higher hub scores.
- The presence of the keyword and links pointing to/from other relevant pages affect the hub and authority weights.
### Aggregated PageRank:
- Considers webpage contents/text in addition to links while calculating rank.
- Webpages containing the relevant keywords in significant portions of text receive a higher numeric value.
- Incoming links still improve the rank through the standard PageRank algorithm applied later.
### M-HITS Algorithm:
- Assigns weights to on-page factors like keywords, boldwords, etc. that influence ranking.
- Pages with more occurrences of the relevant keyword receive a higher composite score.
- Backlinks can increase hub/authority weights as per standard HITS formulation.
In summary, these algorithms leverage keywords, links and various on-page factors in different ways to estimate the importance and relevance of pages for search queries.
# Conclusions & Future Work
- SEO will continue to evolve along with search algorithms
- Ongoing focus for developers to optimize websites
## Note
- SEO will continue to evolve along with advances in search engine algorithms. As algorithms incorporate new signals and rankings methods, SEO strategies need to adapt accordingly. This ensures websites are properly optimized for the latest approaches.
- Developers and website owners need to continuously learn new SEO best practices and techniques. Search engines like Google regularly update their algorithms, so optimization methods that worked well previously may need to be refined.
- With the growing volume of online information, search engines will enhance algorithms to more accurately determine highly relevant content. This places an ongoing focus on developers to optimize websites, content and user experience over time.
- Papers referenced in the literature review propose new algorithms/enhancements to existing methods like PageRank and HITS. This underscores that algorithms will evolve as research progresses.
- SEO analytic techniques also need to evolve to provide insights on performance under new algorithms. This helps developers further optimize sites.
- Off-page signals leveraged by SEO, like links, social signals etc will also continue changing. Developers must understand impact of such changes on optimizations.

So in summary, the rapid pace of algorithm/signal development means SEO and website optimization requires consistent, ongoing effort from developers and marketers to stay aligned with search engine priorities - ensuring the best possible search visibility over the long run.
