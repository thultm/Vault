# Basic IR System Architecture
![[Pasted image 20230908153158.png]]
- Components in information retrieval system 
	- A user has an information need, which underlies and drives the search process 
	- User constructs and issues a query to the IR system 
	- Search engine is to maintain and manipulate an inverted index for a document collection 
	- Index provides a mapping between terms and the locations in the collection in which they occur
- Search engine has played an important role in IR system. Its primary goals include: 
	- Effectiveness (quality): retrieve the most relevant set of documents possible for a query 
	- Efficiency (speed): process queries from users as quickly as possible
- Search engine has two major components 
	- Indexing process ![[Pasted image 20230908154001.png]]
		- Like an appendix
	- Query process ![[Pasted image 20230908154013.png]]
# Building blocks 
## Text acquisition
- Task: identify and make available the documents that will be searched 
	- Crawler 
		- General web crawler 
			- Follow the links on web pages to discover and download new pages 
			- Efficiently find huge numbers of web pages (coverage) and keep them up-to-date (freshness) 
			- Single site crawlers for site search 
			- Topical or focused crawlers for vertical search 
		- Document crawlers for enterprise and desktop search 
			- Follow links and scan directories
	- Feeds 
		- Mechanism for accessing a real-time stream of documents 
			- News feed is a constant stream of news stories and updates 
		- A search engine acquires new documents from a feed simply by monitoring it 
			- RSS is a common standard used for web feeds for content such as news, blogs, or video
	- Conversion 
		- Convert documents into a consistent text plus metadata format HTML, XML, PDF, Word, … → XML 
		- Convert text encoding for different languages 
			- 8-bit ASCII code represents 256 characters, Chinese have many more than 256 characters → cannot by represented 8-bit ASCII 
			- Unicode (16-bit words) represent most of the world’s languages
	- Document data store
		- Database used to manage large numbers of documents and the structured data that is associated with them 
		- Stores text, metadata and other related content (links or anchor text) for documents 
		- Provides very fast access to document contents for search engine components 
		- Can use a relational database system to store documents and metadata 
			- Use a simpler, more efficient storage system is used because of huge numbers of documents
## Text transformation
- Parser 
	- Processing the sequence of text tokens in the document to recognize structural elements
		- e.g., titles, links, headings, etc. 
	- Tokenizer recognizes “words” in the text 
		- Must consider issues like capitalization, hyphens, apostrophes, non-alpha characters, separators 
	- Markup languages such as HTML, XML often used to specify structure
		- Tags used to specify document elements: E.g. <h/2> Overview <h/2>
		- Document parser uses syntax of markup language (or other formatting) to identify structure 
- Stopping 
	- Remove common words 
		- e.g., “and”, “or”, “the”, “in” 
	- Some impact on efficiency and effectiveness 
	- Can be a problem for some queries 
- Stemming 
	- Group words derived from a common stem 
		- e.g., “computer”, “computers”, “computing”, “compute” 
	- Usually effective, but not for all queries 
	- Benefits vary for different languages 
- Link extraction and analysis 
	- Makes use of links and anchor text in web pages 
	- Link analysis identifies popularity and community information 
		- e.g., PageRank, Hubs & Authorities 
	- Anchor text can significantly enhance the representation of pages pointed to by links 
	- Significant impact on web search 
		- Less importance in other applications 
- Information Extraction 
	- Identify classes of index terms that are important for some applications 
	- e.g., named entity recognizers identify classes such as people, locations, companies, dates, etc. 
- Classifier 
	- Identifies class-related metadata for documents 
		- i.e., assigns labels to documents (identifying documents as spam, and identifying the non-content parts of documents, such as advertising)
		- e.g., topics (“sports”, “politics”, or “business”), reading levels, sentiment, genre 
	- Use depends on application
## Evaluation 
- Based on good test dataset
- Based on user
