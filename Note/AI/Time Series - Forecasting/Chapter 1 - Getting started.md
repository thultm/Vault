> _Tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods._  
> \-(Isaiah 41:23)
# 1.1 What can be forecast?
- Forecasting is required in many situations.
- The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:
  1. how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;
  2. how much data is available;
  3. how similar the future is to the past;
  4. whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.
- A forecasting model is intended to capture the way things move, not just where things are.
  > _“If we could first know where we are and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to do and how to do it”._
  > \- Abraham Lincoln
- Forecasting situations vary widely in their time horizons, factors determining actual outcomes, types of data patterns, and many other aspects. 
- Forecasting methods can be simple, or highly complex.
- The choice of method depends on what data are available and the predictability of the quantity to be forecast.
# 1.2 Forecasting, goals and planning
- Forecasting is a common statistical task in business, it helps to inform decisions in production, transportation, and personnel scheduling.
- However, business forecasting is often done poorly, and is frequently confused with planning and goals.
	- **Forecasting:** is about predicting the future as accurately as possible, given all of the information available, including historical data and knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecasts.
	- **Goals:** are what you would like to have happen. 
		- Goals should be linked to forecasts and plans, but this does not always occur. 
		- Too often, goals are set without any plan for how to achieve them, and no forecasts for whether they are realistic.
	- **Planning:** is a response to forecasts and goals. 
		- Planning involves determining the appropriate actions that are required to make your forecasts match your goals.
- Modern organisations require short-term, medium-term and long-term forecasts, depending on the specific application.
	- **Short-term forecasts:** are needed for the scheduling of personnel, production and transportation. 
		- As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.
	- **Medium-term forecasts:** are needed to determine future resource requirements, in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy machinery and equipment.
	- **Long-term forecasts:** are used in strategic planning. 
		- Such decisions must take account of market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources.

An organisation needs to develop a forecasting system that involves several approaches to predicting uncertain events. It is also important to have strong organisational support for the use of formal forecasting methods if they are to be used successfully.
# 1.3 Determining what to forecast
- In the early stages of a forecasting project, decisions need to be made about what should be forecast.
	%%
	For example, if forecasts are required for items in a manufacturing environment, it is necessary to ask whether forecasts are needed for:
	
	1. every product line, or for groups of products?
	2. every sales outlet, or for outlets grouped by region, or only for total sales?
	3. weekly data, monthly data or annual data?
	%%
- It is also necessary to consider the forecasting horizon. 
  %% 
  Will forecasts be required for one month in advance, for 6 months, or for ten years? Different types of models will be necessary, depending on what forecast horizon is most important.
  %%
- How frequently are forecasts required?
  %%
  Forecasts that need to be produced frequently are better done using an automated system than with methods that require careful manual work.
  %%
- It is worth spending time talking to the people who will use the forecasts.
  %%
  To ensure that you understand their needs, and how the forecasts are to be used, before embarking on extensive work in producing the forecasts.
  %%
- Once it has been determined what forecasts are required, it is then necessary to find or collect the data on which the forecasts will be based.
# 1.4 Forecasting data and methods
> _The appropriate forecasting methods depend largely on what data are available._

- If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then **qualitative forecasting** methods must be used.
- **Quantitative forecasting** can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:
	1. numerical information about the past is available;
	2. it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
## Time series forecasting
> _Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series._

- Examples of time series data include:
	- Annual Google profits
	- Quarterly sales results for Amazon
	- Monthly rainfall
	- Weekly retail sales
	- Daily IBM stock prices
	- Hourly electricity demand
	- 5-minute freeway traffic counts
	- Time-stamped stock transaction data
- When forecasting time series data, the aim is to estimate how the sequence of observations will continue into the future.
