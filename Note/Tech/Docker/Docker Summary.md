# Docker commands 
1. **docker run**: This command is used to create and start a container. For example, `docker run hello-world` pulls the 'hello-world' image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container.
    
2. **docker build**: Used to build an image from a Dockerfile. For instance, `docker build -t my-image .` builds an image with the tag "my-image" from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
    
3. **docker images**: Lists all the Docker images on your system.
    
4. **docker ps**: Lists running containers. Adding the `-a` flag (i.e., `docker ps -a`) lists all containers, including those that are stopped.
    
5. **docker stop**: Stops a running container. For example, `docker stop my_container` stops the container named 'my_container'.
    
6. **docker start**: Starts a stopped container.
    
7. **docker rm**: Removes one or more containers. For example, `docker rm my_container` removes the container named 'my_container'.
    
8. **docker rmi**: Removes one or more images. For instance, `docker rmi my-image` removes the image named 'my-image'.
    
9. **docker pull**: Pulls an image from a registry. For example, `docker pull ubuntu` pulls the Ubuntu image from Docker Hub.
    
10. **docker push**: Pushes an image to a registry. If you have an image named 'my-image' and want to push it to Docker Hub, you'd use `docker push my-image`.
    
11. **docker exec**: Runs a command in a running container. For example, `docker exec -it my_container bash` opens a bash shell in 'my_container'.
    
12. **docker logs**: Fetches the logs of a container. Use `docker logs my_container` to see the logs from 'my_container'.
    
13. **docker inspect**: Returns detailed information on containers, images, volumes, or networks. For example, `docker inspect my_container` provides detailed information about 'my_container'.
    
14. **docker compose**: This is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a YAML file, you define services, networks, and volumes, and then use `docker-compose up` to start and run the entire app.

15. **docker network create**: Creates a new network, allowing containers to communicate with each other and the outside world. For example, `docker network create my_network` creates a new network named 'my_network'.
    
16. **docker volume create**: Creates a new volume for persistent data storage independent of container lifecycle. You can use `docker volume create my_volume` to create a new volume named 'my_volume'.
