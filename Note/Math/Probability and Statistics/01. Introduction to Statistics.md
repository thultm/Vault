    - Parameter: characteristics of population. “average” cost
    - Sample (n): a portion (con) of population. = {30 textbooks}
    - Statistics: characteristics of sample. “average” cost of 30 textbooks
    - Variable: characteristics of elements. Cost
    - Data: actual value of variable. $10
- Ex: The average cost of statistics textbooks, you survey 30 textbooks.
- Ex:

| Company | Profit (2021) |
| ------- | ------------- |
| A       | 25            |
| B       | 30            |
| C       | 40            |
    Sample: 3 companies
    Variable: Profit
    Data: 25, 30, 40
    Element: Company

     Sample: every sixth person
## Collect Data

- Retrospective Study (Nghiên cứu hồi cố, Historical Data)
- Observation Study: observe, measure
- Experiment Study
- Simulation Study: using models → data.
- Survey
    - Sample > 40
    - Population: CENSUS
## Type Of Data

- Qualitative (Định tính): Gender, color, major…
- Quantitative (Định lượng):
    - numbers
    - counting measure
        - discrete: the number of… (table, cars…)
        - continuous: temperature, salary, height…
## Sampling Method

- Representative (Lấy mẫu đại diện)
- Replacement / Without replacement (Hoàn lại / Không hoàn lại)
- Non-random (Không ngẫu nhiên): not representative
- Random Sampling (Same chance)
    - Simple Random
    - Stratified
